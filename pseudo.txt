API that returns correct calculations based on string sent through postman / correct route.
Extra routes can be made to return deployment information or test results perhaps.

- Build the code with node.js, Express
- Use the open AI format /swagger to define your API 
- Handling errors (404 etc) -> specify the json returned
-  Error handling -> calculator says E when something goes wrong.
E: Details of error
- Run testing
- running the build creates the 'artifact' which can then be deployed on martinrombachdev

CI -
- Build once a day at the PR stage.
- Expect failure for now, 

testing pull request

1. Make sure your code is running on pull request -> yaml file must be configured on github
CORS - API should be open to any callers, but ips should be limited.
