API that returns correct calculations based on string sent through postman / correct route.

CI workflow should be configured at the start of the project, then you can simulate branches by working from v1

- Node.js API -> could be a chance to do popular framework for routing? or just Express is okay?
- Continuous integration phase 
'backlog and design' phase? (not really applicable)
how can tests be integrated into the build and automated?
artifacts created in a build with tests
- Continuous deployment phase
save exponents and other new features for the cd phase
collaborator could add instead of you?
Use Dad's, he doesn't need it?
- Cloud deployment? AWS Lamda?

Frontend Site with 'how the calculator was deployed' info? Or is this info available on github actions?

API operates on a single route?

1. build the code with node.js, Express
2. Use the open AI format /swagger to define your API 
3. Handling errors (404 etc) -> specify the json returned
Error handling -> calculator says E when something goes wrong.
E: Details of error
4. Understand the hook system - whenever a commit occurs, then run this workflow
- run testing, run different os stuff 
4. running the build creates the 'artifact' which can then be deployed on lambda / firebase

CI -
- Build once a day at the PR stage.
- Expect failure for now
