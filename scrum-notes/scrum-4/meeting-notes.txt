Config CI
- artifacts tied individually to the node version.
- use the node-version variable in the yaml to define the artifact? (Check if Github Actions can do this.)
How do you get the artifact number within the workflow?
How do you set the download to the artifact number using the workflow?

CI phase workflow
Each workflow should:
1. âœ”init, install and test the project
2. delete the old artifact
3. create an artifact with a unique versioned identifier.
Increment version should be on third digit e.g. 0.0.1
NOTE: Choose 1 version of Node (most popular release) and keep to that scope. This project is taking too long.

CD phase workflow
Each workflow should:
1. pull the artifact, unzip and deploy via ftp to namecheap
2. perhaps do end to end testing at this point
3. make a backup of the artifact for future deployment problems (within namecheap)

How do you make the CD workflow run after the CI workflow?
Which of the three nodes are we going to deploy?
Where are we going to deploy it?

What format is the artifact in? How do you handle that? (e.g. zip needed unzipping)
