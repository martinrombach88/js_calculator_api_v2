incrementing versions:
your release version will be 0.6?


then issues will be called
'can't use exponents!' (major? minor? patch?)
'can't use nested brackets!'

then ci will kick in and new versions will be made

!Bug! attempted to add versioning to the pipeline
      - name: increment version by semver patch
        run: npm version patch
      - name: publish version
        run: npm publish
Run npm version patch
npm ERR! Git working directory not clean.

Notes:
I have a library that can execute semantic versioning on release, via Github Actions.
