incrementing versions:
your release version will be 0.6?

then issues will be called
'can't use exponents!' (major? minor? patch?)
'can't use nested brackets!'

then ci will kick in and new versions will be made

!Bug! attempted to add versioning to the pipeline
      - name: increment version by semver patch
        run: npm version patch
      - name: publish version
        run: npm publish
Run npm version patch
npm ERR! Git working directory not clean.

!bug! Node.js 16 actions are deprecated. Please update the following actions to use Node.js 20: actions/setup-node@v3. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/.

✔Choose a new release of Node.js and stick to that single release. (20 is fine) Focus on making any working workflow, different node versions can be a future feature.

✔Artifact uploaded.

Next: deployment
- download and deploy on netlify

Current state:
Environment variables set up
Deployment 'successful' via github workflow
!bug! CD workflow triggering separately before ci workflow 
!bug! Netlify returns a HTML page with a 404 (rather than just the json)

'In the netlify.toml or the Netlify UI, set a placeholder build command to ensure Netlify builds your functions. For example, the command could be echo Building Functions.'

!bug! Deployment on Netlify and Namecheap isn't practical.
- Namecheap cannot deploy the app because of a version mismatch and inability to deploy in a continuous way. (max version of Node.js is 14)
- Currently have been unable to configure Netlify for deployment.

Next: 
- Investigate AWS Lambda (is it free? does it work for the API?)
or
- Investigate Netlify - are Express apps really no longer supported? If it's using Lambda anyway, why use Netlify?

!logic issue! 
AWS -> Tried a tutorial for s3 and SAM (SAM is itself a configurable API).
If you were to use SAM, you would need to supply the calculator to SAM itself.
Deploy the app instead, return to SAM for a project redo maybe.

Options:
- Lambda
- AMI
- EC2
- Elastic Beanstalk 
- OpsWork


!cost issue!
Amazon Free Tier is unavailable, so to avoid costs, the project will 
use a combination of a local ftp server and Github Actions. Actions
will automatically upload the artifact, and then run a script to
deliver the software. The ftp server will automatically deploy it.
