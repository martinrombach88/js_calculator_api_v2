incrementing versions:
your release version will be 0.6?

then issues will be called
'can't use exponents!' (major? minor? patch?)
'can't use nested brackets!'

then ci will kick in and new versions will be made

!bug! Node.js 16 actions are deprecated. Please update the following actions to use Node.js 20: actions/setup-node@v3. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/.

✔Choose a new release of Node.js and stick to that single release. (20 is fine) Focus on making any working workflow, different node versions can be a future feature.
