Trello Tasks:
âœ”Convert main request to post (use TDD as well) 

Fix deployment
!Bug! Express causing CI not to deploy.
-> Running build on Node 18 only fixes the bug. Which means your program is not backwards compatible(?)
!Bug! Npm run test never finishes.
-> This bug is not related to async tests, commenting out async tests has no effect.

Close this branch and continue in a new branch.

Find types for req/res
Build a logger - logging to a folder / text file (this is a backend application, you should not be console logging, you should be logging to file)
Error handling - you should be sending a 400 error + error: invalid expression for the calculator (define outputs)
End to End Test / functional test
Apply Open API format
