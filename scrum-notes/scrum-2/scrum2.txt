Trello Tasks:
✔Convert main request to post (use TDD as well) 

Configure CI
!Bug! Node version 14 doesn't support dependencies.
✔Fixed: Running build on Node 18 only fixes the bug. Revisit this.

!Bug! Unable to resolve action `actions/checkout@v3`, repository or version not found
-> Closed the post request branch and continued in a 'configuring-for-ci' branch.
-> Cancelled all workflows that were stuck in testing phase and continuously running.
-> Following Github Actions documentation example as workflow is borrowed from blog and may be out of date.
✔Fixed: Used a new workflow template with 'actions/checkout@v4' to remedy bug.

!Bug! Npm run test never finishes.
-> This bug is not related to async tests, commenting out async tests has no effect.
-> There's an issue with the Github Actions API allegedly.
-> Cancelled all workflows as server was returning a 500 a lot.
-> Test suite was running 'watch' in the CI server so it was waiting for input.
✔Fixed: Created separate 'test' and 'dev-test' scripts to run watcher function in development mode only.

!Bug! Imports for express not recognised in the second set of tests.
 TypeError: (0 , express_1.default) is not a function

Find types for req/res
Build a logger - logging to a folder / text file (this is a backend application, you should not be console logging, you should be logging to file)
Error handling - you should be sending a 400 error + error: invalid expression for the calculator (define outputs)
End to End Test / functional test
Apply Open API format
