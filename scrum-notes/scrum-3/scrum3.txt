✔Configure import syntax for jest/typescript (revisited)

!bug!
Jest testing imports only run independently, without the server running. 
They require a special import syntax that crashes the server itself.
It's simulating the server and so the server can't be run at the same time.

✔Fixed - using tsconfig supplied by ts-node docs and dependency/unnecessary file clear out complete. Imports now both on same syntax.

✔Error handling on the post request.
- user sends an invalid expression -> rejection message
- finally / unexpected

3. Logger - Node.js logging to file. Save locally requests with responses. Set max length, max number.
- Log all errors (try/catch routes)
- Log all requests (try/catch routes)

Stretch Goal:
4. Configuring CI with a workflow that includes versioning, releases
