!bug!
Jest testing imports only run independently, without the server running. 
They require a special import syntax that crashes the server itself.
It's simulating the server and so the server can't be run at the same time.

New ticket: Switch to Cypress and end-to-end testing.
https://www.cypress.io/

1. Install cypress, remove the function testing and create an end to end test for the post request.
This must be done first to follow TDD.
2. Error handling on the post request.
- user sends an invalid expression -> rejection message
- finally / unexpected
3. Logger - Node.js logging to file. Save locally requests with responses. Set max length, max number.
- Log all errors (try/catch routes)
- Log all requests (try/catch routes)

Stretch Goal:
4. Configuring CI with a workflow that includes versioning, releases
