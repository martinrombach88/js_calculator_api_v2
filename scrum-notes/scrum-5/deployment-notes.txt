Deployment explanation:

1. Typescript issues were resolved by correctly transpiling Typescript to Javascript and using index.js in production
2. Connections to AWS were resolved by using the IP address rather than the host name
3. The repository was uploaded as a zip (without node modules), and delivered via scp (secure copy)
using ssh as a transport. SSH keys were defined on the instance.
4. Deployment of the Node.js project was achieved within the SSH session, with linux commands
and npm commands run directly while logged in.
