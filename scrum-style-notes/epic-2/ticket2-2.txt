Current:

- Local shows us expected result, original post request was saved.
- Investigation should continue into how the app is configured and whether namecheap (or another service) is capable of acting as a Node.js API and returning basic JSON

Example deployment - try deploying a JS only 
simple express app that receives and returns json.

See express-example folder for index.js example.
Maintain edits in both the deployed example and 
github reference folder.

! express example deployed having similar issues to the calculator
typescript not the problem (local deployment ok).

Does namecheap's web app include an api? Or will it always return a html because its supposed to be full stack?

Can you deploy the calculator via SSH instead for more control?

Can you use Amazon again instead of the name cheap service at a reasonable price? What about azure free tier? 

Deploy on amazon via Azure Functions
