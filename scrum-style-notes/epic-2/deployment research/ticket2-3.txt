azure with free tier offers a deployment solution
in the form of Azure Functions

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1689311/can-i-create-an-azure-function-app-with-a-free-tie 

should be good for further deployment work (especially csharp)

App was deployed, but postman currently returns a 404 on the endpoint.
Post request to home link returns a html document.

Documentation does specify that Azure Functions can be used to deploy APIs (and in free tier, as is the budget).

You probably haven't configured it properly.

Page includes 'functions' (possibly like AWS lambda functions), this should be the next point to research.

Build provider is github actions, so your workflow should be designed for azure (rather than aws ec2). Right now it's the EC2 log in and deploy business.

Next - create a new workflow for azure.
