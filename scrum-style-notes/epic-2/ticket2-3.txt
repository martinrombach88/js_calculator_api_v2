progress:

azure with free tier offers a deployment solution
in the form of Azure Functions

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1689311/can-i-create-an-azure-function-app-with-a-free-tie 

should be good for further deployment work (especially csharp)

App was deployed, but postman currently returns a 404 on the endpoint.
Post request to home link returns a html document.
